    /* We use inheritance or composition to extend the behavior of an object but this
     * is done at compile time and its applicable to all the instances of the class.
     * We can’t add any new functionality of remove any existing behavior at runtime –
     * this is when Decorator pattern comes into picture.
     *
     * Suppose we want to implement different kinds of cars – we can create interface
     * Car to define the assemble method and then we can have a Basic car, further
     * more we can extend it to Sports car and Luxury Car.
     *
     * But if we want to get a car at runtime that has both the features of sports car
     * and luxury car, then the implementation gets complex and if further more we want
     * to specify which features should be added first, it gets even more complex. Now
     * imagine if we have ten different kind of cars, the implementation logic using
     * inheritance and composition will be impossible to manage. To solve this kind of
     * programming situation, we apply decorator pattern in java.
